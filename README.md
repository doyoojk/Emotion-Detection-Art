# Emotion-Detection-Art
Interactive Art piece that outputs different images based on audience's emotions. 

The art piece identifies the audience's emotions through OpenCV using a facial recognition AI (trained with the CNN model using the FER2013 dataset). The identified emotion is then rendered into an image through Python Turtle, which creates an interactive experience for the audience.
